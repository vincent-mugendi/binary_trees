This is an ALX project that implements binary tree data structures.

Binary trees are a type of tree data structure where each node has at most two children. They are a versatile and efficient data structure for storing and retrieving data, and are used in a wide variety of applications, such as databases, compilers, and operating systems.

This ALX project covers the following topics:
- Implementation of bionary trees in c
- Common operations in Binary Trees such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
